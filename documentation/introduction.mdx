# Mutual Dissent

Cross-vendor multi-model debate engine that sends queries to multiple AI models simultaneously, shares competing responses for reflection and critique, then synthesizes a final answer.

## What it does

- **Fan-out** — sends your query to multiple models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok) in parallel
- **Reflection** — shares competing responses back to each model for critique
- **Synthesis** — a user-selected model distills the debate into a final answer
- **Transcripts** — full debate logs as structured JSON for research and analysis

## Quick start

```bash
pip install mutual-dissent
mutual-dissent ask "Your query here" --panel claude,gpt,gemini --synthesizer claude
```
